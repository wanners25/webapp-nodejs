git status - initially shows all untracked files
git add .  - will add all files and set them ready for commit
git commit -m 'setup app for HEROKU'

Note :- If the changes are not reflected in GITHUB , it might be due to missing connection between Github with Application due to shut down or logoff
In such case give Push command one more time - 

git push -u origin master
